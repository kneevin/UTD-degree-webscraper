The Graduate Studies Committee, after consultation with the student and appropriate faculty members, may approve the project and committee or require changes. It is the student's responsibility to find a faculty advisor agreeing to supervise the work and receive approval to proceed with the project. Such agreement and approval is not guaranteed by admission to one of the MAT programs.

In addition to regularly offered courses, students can register for up to six hours of independent studies (PPPE 8V01) to explore dissertation topics with the approval of an individual faculty member to supervise the study. Once a student has identified a likely topic and/or likely dissertation supervisor, the Dissertation Seminar (PPPE 8V98) allows a more formal direction of the dissertation proposal itself. Generally students should defend the proposal in the first semester they register for Dissertation Seminar, and all students should defend a dissertation proposal by the end of the third year (preferably second). Students seeking advising concerning a suitable dissertation topic or appropriate supervisor are encouraged to consult with the Program Head and/or Director of Graduate Studies.', 'Students take free electives in areas of interest to fulfill the 75-semester credit hour PhD requirement.
