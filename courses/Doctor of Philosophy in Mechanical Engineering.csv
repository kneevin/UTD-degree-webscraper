"A MS student in ME must take a total of four core courses, selected from two or more concentration areas from the list of the four concentration areas below, and must receive a grade of B- or better in the four core courses. A student must maintain a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 to remain in good standing and satisfy the degree requirements."
