Students who complete the major in Latin American Studies will explore the region through three main avenues of study: (1) history; (2) economics, political science, and business; and (3) literature, language, and culture. Students are encouraged to specialize in one of these pillars while incorporating the program's multidisciplinary perspective.
Since the following catalog course descriptions are very general, students are urged to consult the detailed course descriptions available on the web site for the School of Arts and Humanities. At least one-half of the semester credit hours for a major must be taken at UT Dallas.
Courses in Latin American Studies are open to all students in the University.
